Objects in OOP
  -->Real world entities.

Classes
  -->Self created data types.
  -->example--date class.

Encapsulation
  -->packaging of data values and functions within an object.

Data hiding
  -->making the data inaccesible from outside the object.

Inheritance
  -->new class inherit data from the base class besides its own data.
   
polymorphism
 -->to represent one type of member function in one or more ways.

Containership
  -->to represent group of objects using different class.

Templates
  -->only one generic function is created and as per the need compiler creates its own function.

Exception Handling
  -->robust program which is used to handle errors during execution.

Reusability
  -->OOP is built on the reusable component.

Reference Variable
  -->Acts as a rerference to other variable.
  -->It contains address of the variable that it is referring to.
  -->"&" is used to define the address of any variable or any memory.

Pointers 
  -->>

Functions
 -->Function prototype is declaration defines name of function,its parameter,its return type.


Recursion
 -->


Stack Overflow
 -->Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where they wait for  the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 

  But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.
